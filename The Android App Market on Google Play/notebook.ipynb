Although it can be a very tedious process, it's worth should never be undermined.</p>\n","<p>By looking at a random sample of the dataset rows (from the above task), we observe that some entries in the columns like <code>Installs</code> and <code>Price</code> have a few special characters (<code>+</code> <code>,</code> <code>$</code>) due to the way the numbers have been represented. This prevents the columns from being purely numeric, making it difficult to use them in subsequent future mathematical calculations. Ideally, as their names suggest, we would want these columns to contain only digits from [0-9].</p>\n","<p>Hence, we now proceed to clean our data. Specifically, the special characters <code>,</code> and <code>+</code> present in <code>Installs</code> column and <code>$</code> present in <code>Price</code> column need to be removed.</p>\n","<p>It is also always a good practice to print a summary of your dataframe after completing data cleaning.

Sentiment analysis of user reviews\n","<p>Mining user review data to determine how people feel about your product, brand, or service can be done using a technique called sentiment analysis. User reviews for apps can be analyzed to identify if the mood is positive, negative or neutral about that app. For example, positive words in an app review might include words such as 'amazing', 'friendly', 'good', 'great', and 'love'. Negative words might be words like 'malware', 'hate', 'problem', 'refund', and 'incompetent'.</p>\n","<p>By plotting sentiment polarity scores of user reviews for paid and free apps, we observe that free apps receive a lot of harsh comments, as indicated by the outliers on the negative y-axis. Reviews for paid apps appear never to be extremely negative. This may indicate something about app quality, i.e., paid apps being of higher quality than free apps on average. The median polarity score for paid apps is a little higher than free apps, thereby syncing with our previous observation.</p>\n","<p>In this notebook, we analyzed over ten thousand apps from the Google Play Store.
